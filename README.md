## 💰 The Problem

In production, **a large percentage of LLM requests are repetitive**:

* **RAG applications**: Variations of the same employee questions
* **AI Agents**: Repeated reasoning steps or tool calls
* **Support Bots**: Thousands of similar customer queries

Every redundant request means **extra token cost** and **extra latency**.

Why pay your LLM provider multiple times for the *same answer*?

---

## 💡 The Solution: PromptCache

PromptCache is a lightweight middleware that sits between your application and your LLM provider.
It uses **semantic understanding** to detect when a new prompt has *the same intent* as a previous one — and returns the cached result instantly.

## 📊 Key Benefits

| Metric                      | Without Cache | With PromptCache | Benefit      |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| **Cost per 1,000 Requests** | ≈ $30         | **≈ $6**         | Lower cost   |
| **Avg Latency**         | ~1.5s         | **~300ms**       | Faster UX    |
| **Throughput**              | API-limited   | **Unlimited**    | Better scale |

Numbers vary per model, but the pattern holds across real workloads:
**semantic caching dramatically reduces cost and latency**.

\* Results may vary depending on model, usage patterns, and configuration.

## 🧠 Smart Semantic Matching (Safer by Design)

Naive semantic caches can be risky — they may return incorrect answers when prompts look similar but differ in intent.

PromptCache uses a **two-stage verification strategy** to ensure accuracy:

1. **High similarity → direct cache hit**
2. **Low similarity → skip cache directly**
3. **Gray zone → intent check using a small, cheap verification model**

This ensures cached responses are **semantically correct**, not just “close enough”.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

PromptCache works as a **drop-in replacement** for the OpenAI API.

### 1. Run with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/messkan/prompt-cache.git
cd prompt-cache

# Set your embedding provider (default: openai)
export EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai  # Options: openai, mistral, claude

# Set your provider API key(s)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key_here
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
# export VOYAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Required for Claude embeddings

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Run from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/messkan/prompt-cache.git
cd prompt-cache

# Set environment variables
export EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Option 1: Use the run script (recommended)
./scripts/run.sh

# Option 2: Use Make
make run

# Option 3: Build and run manually
go build -o prompt-cache cmd/api/main.go
./prompt-cache
```

### 3. Run Benchmarks

Test the performance and cache effectiveness:

```bash
# Set your API keys first
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Run the full benchmark suite (HTTP-based)
./scripts/benchmark.sh
# or
make benchmark

# Run Go micro-benchmarks (unit-level performance)
go test ./internal/semantic/... -bench=. -benchmem
# or
make bench-go
```

**Example benchmark results:**
```
BenchmarkCosineSimilarity-12      2593046    441.0 ns/op    0 B/op    0 allocs/op
BenchmarkFindSimilar-12            50000    32000 ns/op  2048 B/op   45 allocs/op
```

### 4. Available Make Commands

```bash
make help           # Show all available commands
make build          # Build the binary
make test           # Run unit tests
make benchmark      # Run full benchmark suite
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
make docker-build   # Build Docker image
make docker-run     # Run with Docker Compose
```

Simply change the `base_url` in your SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1",  # Point to PromptCache
    api_key="your-openai-api-key"
)

# First request → goes to the LLM provider
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum physics"}]
)

# Semantically similar request → served from PromptCache
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "How does quantum physics work?"}]
)
```

No code changes. Just point your client to PromptCache.

## 🔧 Provider Configuration

PromptCache supports multiple AI providers for embeddings and semantic verification. Select your provider using the `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

### Setting the Provider

```bash
export EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai  # Options: openai, mistral, claude
```

If not specified, **OpenAI** is used by default.

### OpenAI (Default)
```bash
export EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
- **Embedding Model**: `text-embedding-3-small`
- **Verification Model**: `gpt-4o-mini`

### Mistral AI
```bash
export EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=mistral
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_key
```
- **Embedding Model**: `mistral-embed`
- **Verification Model**: `mistral-small-latest`

### Claude (Anthropic)
```bash
export EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
export VOYAGE_API_KEY=your_voyage_key  # Required for embeddings
```
- **Embedding Model**: `voyage-3` (via Voyage AI)
- **Verification Model**: `claude-3-haiku-20240307`

> **Note**: Claude uses Voyage AI for embeddings as recommended by Anthropic. You'll need both API keys.

### Switching Providers

The provider is automatically selected at startup based on the `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` environment variable. Simply set the variable and restart the service:

```bash
# Switch to Mistral
export EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=mistral
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key
docker-compose restart

# Switch to Claude
export EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
export VOYAGE_API_KEY=your_voyage_key
docker-compose restart
```

### Advanced Configuration

Fine-tune the semantic cache behavior with these optional environment variables:

#### Similarity Thresholds

```bash
# High threshold: Direct cache hit (default: 0.70)
# Scores >= this value return cached results immediately
export CACHE_HIGH_THRESHOLD=0.70

# Low threshold: Clear miss (default: 0.30)
# Scores < this value skip the cache entirely
export CACHE_LOW_THRESHOLD=0.30
```

**Recommended ranges:**
- High threshold: 0.65-0.85 (higher = stricter matching)
- Low threshold: 0.25-0.40 (lower = more aggressive caching)
- Always ensure: `HIGH_THRESHOLD > LOW_THRESHOLD`

#### Gray Zone Verifier

```bash
# Enable/disable LLM verification for gray zone scores (default: true)
# Gray zone = scores between low and high thresholds
export ENABLE_GRAY_ZONE_VERIFIER=true  # or false, 0, 1, yes, no
```

**When to disable:**
- Cost optimization (skip verification API calls)
- Speed priority (accept slightly lower accuracy)
- Prompts are highly standardized

**Keep enabled for:**
- Production environments requiring high accuracy
- Varied prompt patterns
- Critical applications where wrong answers are costly

## 🔌 API Management

### Dynamic Provider Switching

Change the embedding provider at runtime without restarting the service.

#### Get Current Provider

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/config/provider
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "available_providers": ["openai", "mistral", "claude"]
}
```

#### Switch Provider

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/config/provider \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider": "mistral"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Provider updated successfully",
  "provider": "mistral"
}
```

**Use cases:**
- A/B testing different providers
- Fallback to alternative providers during outages
- Cost optimization by switching based on load
- Testing provider performance in production
